# OpenCI
Open Source Computer Intelligence Library


## TODO for myself
- Add appropriate readme file here
- Add JavaDoc to source files
- Provide good and clean API 
- ...

### Note 1:
For making standalone library file
- create zip archive of OpenCI folder
- rename it to jar

After importing OpenCI classes to your own project/source code, 

- compile your source with "javac -cp .;{path-to-jar}/OpenCI.jar {your-public-class}.java" 
- run with "java -cp .;{path-to-jar}/OpenCI.jar {your-public-class}"

Edit {path-to-jar} with your jar location and {your-public-class} with your source filename which contains your public(main) class
